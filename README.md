## Delphi Version

This project is written in Delphi 10.4. While it should work fine on other version of Delphi, there are no guarantees. The older the Delphi version, the less likely this library will be compatible.

### JDLib

The test applications uses controls from [JDLib, a separate repository of mine](https://github.com/djjd47130/JDLib).

### TChromeTabs

The test application uses the [`TChromeTabs` control](https://github.com/norgepaul/TChromeTabs).
